    Garden design, installation, and maintenance plans are individually priced. We will make
    a complimentary visit to the site and develop a proposal for your consideration.

    We always check with the cemetery administrator before undertaking any planning or planting.
     In some instances, due to cemetery regulations, Serene & Green may design the garden and purchase
     the plantings, while allowing cemetery staff to manage the installation.</li>

            <p>
              I believe the simple act of working with flowers and plant material is therapeutic, both lifting your mood and calming your mind. Too many people are intimidated by the act of “arranging” flowers, feeling only floral experts can create a beautiful bouquet. Serene & Green is on a mission to take the mystery out of flower-arranging—and put a smile on your face in the process! Through flower-filled workshops and access to professional grade florist tools, I’m here to boost your confidence and your well-being.

  I emphasize the “green” in Serene & Green and promote eco-friendly floral design techniques. I do not use traditional floral foam in any of my arrangements or workshops, as it is a single-use product that is formaldehyde-based and does not break down in landfills. I am constantly seeking new methods, techniques, and mechanics for arranging flower stems that are more sustainable and am excited to share some of my favorite tools and design products with home designers.

  In addition, knowing that flowers and greenery can have a healing effect, I offer personalized care and garden design for gravesites in the greater Philadelphia area. Clients have found tremendous peace of mind seeing their loved one’s final resting place cared for with respect, compassion, and an eye for beauty.

  Whether it’s a vase filled with colorful blossoms or a beautified cemetery plot, flowers will fill your mind with beauty… and allow joy to bloom within you.

  We emphasize the “green” in Green Earth Cemetries and promote eco-friendly floral design techniques. We do not use traditional floral foam in any of our
  arrangements or workshops, as it is a single-use product that is formaldehyde-based and
   does not break down in landfills. We are constantly seeking new methods, techniques, and mechanics for arranging flower stems that are more
   sustainable and we are excited to share some of our favorite tools and design products with home designers.

            <p>
              We believe the simple act of working with flowers and plant material is therapeutic, both lifting your mood and
               calming your mind. Too many people are intimidated by the act of “arranging” flowers,
               feeling only floral experts can create a beautiful bouquet. Green Earth Cemetries is
                on a mission to take the mystery out of flower-arranging—and put a smile on your face in
                 the process! Through flower-filled workshops and access to professional grade florist tools, We`re here to boost your confidence and your well-being.

<br><br>

  In addition, knowing that flowers and greenery can have a healing effect, we offer personalized care and
  garden design for gravesites in Nairobi metropolitan and surrounding areas. Clients have found tremendous peace of mind seeing their loved one’s final resting place cared for with respect, compassion, and an eye for beauty.

  Whether it’s a vase filled with colorful blossoms or a beautified cemetery plot, flowers will fill your mind with beauty and allow joy to bloom within you.

    <p>Cemeteries are generally large and expansive pieces of land, making it hard for the maintenance staff to properly and thoroughly tend to each and every individual gravesite. Their priority is to maintain the grounds, roads, and cemetery buildings as a whole first. It is not practical for a cemetery’s landscaping crew to provide the level of attention that many families desire for their loved one’s final resting place.

Green Earth Cemetries will tend your family member’s gravesite (or multi-grave family plot) throughout the year, giving the site the detailed attention and consistent care it deserves.

Our service ensures that no matter when you or your family members visit, the gravesite will be tidy and well-groomed. On a monthly basis, and as is seasonally appropriate, we will complete the following tasks:</p>
<li>Remove windblown debris and litter, including raking leaves and picking up sticks.</li>

<li>Pull weeds from around the marker and within the grave area.</li>

<li>Deadhead flowers, trim plants, and mulch any planted areas.</li>

<li>Hand-trim grass around the marker and give the grave area a fresh mow.</li>

<li>Add grass seed to any bare patches in the turf.</li>

<li>Dethatch, aerate, and fertilize the turf.</li>

<li>Water the entire site.</li>

<li>Lightly clean the gravestone, removing any dried grass thrown by mowing equipment.</li>

<li>Remove any collected material (weeds, twigs, leaves, spent flowers, etc.) from the site.</li>

<li>Email a photo to all designated family members.</li>
<br>


  <p>
  Whatever your needs are, we can design a care plan just for you.<br> <strong><a href="contact" class="alllinkson">Contact us</a> </strong>  to discuss your specific needs.

        Blooming flowers and lush groundcover surrounding the headstone of a loved one provide ongoing color and beauty throughout the season.

        Working within each cemetery’s guidelines and using the amount of space available to plant, Green Earth Cemeteries can design a unique small-scale garden for your family member’s gravesite. <br><br> Plans may include annuals, perennials, bulbs, groundcovers, and/or small shrubs. We select low-maintenance plants that will stay compact.

      <br> <br> Garden design, installation, and maintenance plans are individually priced. We will make a complimentary visit to the site and develop a proposal for your consideration.

        <br>We always check with the cemetery administrator before undertaking any planning or planting. In some instances, due to cemetery regulations, Green Earth Cemeteries may design the garden and purchase the plantings, while allowing cemetery staff to manage the installation.

    <p><strong>
Who uses your gravesite maintenance and beautification services, and why?
    </strong></p>
    <p>Our clients use our services for a wide variety of reasons, including:</p>
    <li>Individuals who are grateful to visit their family members’ gravesites without the burden of maintenance tasks.</li>
    <li>Seniors who are no longer able to tend to their loved ones’ graves.</li>
    <li>Those who are uncomfortable visiting a cemetery, but find solace in knowing their loved ones are remembered.</li>
    <li>Adults whose work schedules do not allow them time to care for their family members’ graves.</li>
    <li>Friends and family members who live too far away to visit on a regular basis.</li>
    <li>People who need a message or item delivered on a special day.</li>

    <p><strong>Isn’t the cemetery responsible for maintenance of gravesites?</strong> </p>
    <p>Cemeteries provide basic property maintenance such as mowing the grass, removing large
      branches, and maintaining the roads.  However, most cemeteries will not perform individual
      gravesite tasks, such as weeding a site, maintaining the turf, cleaning headstones, mulching plantings,
       or trimming and edging grass. It is not practical for their landscaping crew to provide the level of
        attention that many families desire for their loved one’s final resting place.</p>

      <p><strong>I pay for perpetual care so why do I need a separate grave tending service?</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Perpetual care (also known as endowed or permanent care) funds are used for general maintenance and
        repair of cemetery grounds.The family is responsible for caring for the headstone and keeping the gravesite
        neat and clean.</strong> </p>

      <p><strong>How often do you provide care at a gravesite?</strong> </p>
      <p>Our <a href="#">Forget-Me-Not Service</a> provides year-round visits, ensuring that the site is tidy and well-groomed at all times. Some individuals only request an annual clean-up of the site or watering during the growing season. You can determine what frequency fits your needs.</p>

      <p><strong>Do you offer a discount to care for several gravesites that are located nearby or within the same cemetery?</strong> </p>
      <p>Yes, an entire family plot (up to 8 gravesites) is included in the <a href="#">Forget-Me-Not Service</a> fee.</p>
  </div>


    <div class="faqstarter">

          <img class="styleimgs2" src="assets/img/gravefaqs.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p><strong>What do you mean by a light cleaning of the headstone?</strong> </p>
      <p>Water is generally all that is needed to clean a well-maintained headstone. That said, over
        time, lichen, moss, and mold can adhere to a stone marker. A non-ionic, biological cleaner can
        brighten up the stone and slow future growth. The average fee for this added service is $75 per
        headstone. Pricing depends on the size and condition of the marker. This level of cleaning should only
         be necessary every few years.</p>

        <p><strong>What do you deliver?</strong> </p>
        <p>We deliver fresh floral arrangements, ribbon-tied bouquets, potted plants, wreaths, grave blankets, cards, photos, or other items that you request. We do not deliver artificial flowers.</p>

        <p><strong>What if the cemetery has restrictions?</strong> </p>
        <p>We check your cemetery’s rules and regulations before we place any flowers or other items at the site. You will be informed of any limitations that interfere with your request.</p>

        <p><strong>Can you deliver a message for me?</strong> </p>
        <p>Yes. When we visit a gravesite as part of a care plan or floral delivery, we can read a verbal message, a poem, or a gravesite prayer. We also deliver written messages. Your written message will be kept private, in a sealed envelope.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I select the day that you visit the grave?</strong> </p>
        <p>Yes. We understand that your loved ones need to be remembered on special days, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays. If you would like us to visit on a national holiday, there will be an extra charge.</p>

        <p><strong>Can you plant flowers, bulbs, or shrubs?</strong> </p>
        <p>We can provide any horticultural services or plantings that stay within the cemetery’s guidelines.</p>

        <p><strong>Since I can’t go to the cemetery, how will I know you performed the services I requested?</strong> </p>
        <p>We provide you with a photograph taken at the site, either by email or text. We can also provide printed photos by mail for a small fee.</p>

        <p><strong>I’m not sure of the exact location of the burial site. Can you find it for me?</strong> </p>
        <p>We will make every effort to locate your loved one’s grave with the information you have available. Most cemeteries maintain records that are very helpful. Providing us with the gravesite section and plot number is ideal. At a minimum, we need the name of the cemetery and the name
           on the headstone or marker. There will be an extra fee to locate non-specified grave locations.</p>

        <p><strong>I haven’t been able to visit the gravesite for a long time. I don’t know if the headstone/monument is in disrepair or in need of cleaning.</strong> </p>
        <p>We will notify you if there are any condition problems. You will also be able to view the headstone or monument in the photograph we take at the site after maintenance visits and floral deliveries.</p>

        <p><strong>Will you help with my pet’s memorial?</strong> </p>
        <p>Pets are a part of the family and are memorialized in many ways.  Contact us to see how we can customize a care plan for your beloved pet’s gravesite.</p>

        <p><strong>How do payments work?</strong> </p>
        <p>Annual care plans may be paid in full at the outset or billed on a quarterly basis.
           Floral deliveries must be paid in full before the delivery is made. Fees for garden design,
           installation, and maintenance will be determined on an individual basis. Payments can be made by
           personal check, cash, or credit card through PayPal.

      <p>Flowers bring about positive emotional feelings and make spaces more welcoming. Some of the best places in your home to add floral arrangements are your dining room table or your kitchen island. A bright and sunny arrangement will lift anyone’s mood.

Flowers are also an excellent addition to bedrooms. Not only do they freshen up the decor, but they will also bring a lift to your spirits as you start each day. What’s better than awakening to blooms by your bedside?

And, of course, it’s always a joy to share some floral therapy with a loved one. Deliveries can be made throughout the Main Line and greater Philadelphia area.

Please note that the cost of an arrangement is dependent on the flower varieties used and vase selected. Contact us to discuss your order.</p>

Through the Flower Ninja Project, you create a small floral arrangement and leave it in a public place with a tag that reads “If you find this, it’s for you!” Finders are asked to post images of bouquets they find, to further spread the joy. You can learn more at For the One Who Finds Me. If you and your children want to make and place your own bouquets, here is a link to the instructions, which include tags to print out and tie to the vases. Have fun!</p>
